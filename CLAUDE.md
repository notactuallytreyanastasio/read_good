In this repo we have a directory `old_src`

It is an Electron app.

It's primary functionality is to read some stories from HN/Reddit/Pinboard from the system tray.

It also has a link and tag browser because it saves links as it gets you content throughout the day.

Please consume the documentation and other stuff inside of the repo and understand it.

From there, I would like to build a clone of it natively for OSX.
